										<h2 class="major">Rift valley lakes</h2>
										<p>Rift Valley Lakes are a series of lakes situated within the Great African Rift Valley, a geological trench system that runs through East Africa.<br>
										In Uganda, these lakes are a result of the tectonic forces that formed the Albertine Rift,<br>
										the western branch of the larger East African Rift System.</p>
										<h2>Formation of Rift Valley Lakes in Uganda......</h2>
										<button id = 'toggleBtn' onclick="toggleInfo('showinfo')">Learn more</button>
					
											<div id="showinfo" class="more-info">
												<p>Millions of years ago, the Earth's crust beneath East Africa began to stretch and thin due to the movement of tectonic plates. <br>
												This process led to the formation of a massive fracture system, the Rift Valley.<br>
												Within this valley, the land sank in certain areas, creating depressions known as grabens.<br>
												Over time, these depressions filled with water from rainfall, rivers, and <br>
												underground springs, giving birth to the Rift Valley lakes we see today in Uganda.
												<br>
												The key processes involved in their formation include:
												<h6>Tectonic Activity:</h6> The primary driver is the pulling apart of the Earth's crust, <br>
												causing faulting and the creation of rift valleys.
												<h6>Graben Formation:</h6> As the land stretches, central blocks drop down relative to the surrounding higher blocks, forming the lake basins. 
												<h6>Water Accumulation:</h6> Rainfall and rivers draining into these basins gradually filled them, forming the lakes.
												</p>
												<p>
												Examples of Rift Valley Lakes in Uganda:
												Uganda is home to several significant Rift Valley lakes, including:
												<h5>Lake Albert:</h5> The largest and deepest of Uganda's Rift Valley lakes, <br>located in the Albertine Rift on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
												<h5>Lake Edward:</h5> Situated to the south of Lake Albert, <br>also on the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo and within Queen Elizabeth National Park. 
												<h5>Lake George:</h5> A smaller and shallower lake located northeast of Lake Edward, <br>connected by the Kazinga Channel. It is also within Queen Elizabeth National Park

												Unlike the other freshwater lakes we've discussed, Lake Katwe is a salt lake, playing a crucial economic role for..</p>
											<button id = 'toggleBtn' onclick="toggleInfo('info6')">Read more</button>
					
											<div id="info6" class="more-info" >
												<p>the local communities and holding ecological interest due to its specialized environment. Let's explore its key features:

													Location and Setting
													Lake Katwe is located in the western part of Uganda, within Queen Elizabeth National Park. It's situated near the equator and lies in a volcanic crater, close to other volcanic features like explosion craters. The town of Katwe, adjacent to the lake, is a center for salt mining.

													Physical Characteristics
													Salinity: The most distinctive feature of Lake Katwe is its high salt concentration. Due to the hot, dry climate and the lack of significant outflow, the water evaporates rapidly, leaving behind a high concentration of dissolved minerals, primarily sodium chloride (common salt). This makes it a hypersaline lake.
													Size and Depth: Lake Katwe is relatively small compared to the other Great Lakes in the region. Its size fluctuates with rainfall and evaporation rates, but it generally covers an area of a few square kilometers. It's also quite shallow, with depths typically not exceeding a few meters.
													Appearance: The lake often has a shimmering, white appearance due to the salt crust that forms on its surface, especially during the dry season. Different minerals can also tint the water with hues of pink or other colors depending on the algae and other microorganisms present.
													Economic Importance: Salt Mining
													Salt mining is the primary activity associated with Lake Katwe and has been practiced for centuries using traditional methods.

													Traditional Salt Extraction: Local communities have developed intricate systems of shallow ponds or pans along the edges of the lake. Salty water is channeled into these pans, and as it evaporates under the intense sun, different types of salt crystallize.
													Types of Salt: Various grades of salt are extracted, including:
													Edible salt: Used for consumption.
													Animal salt: Used as a supplement for livestock.
													Industrial salt: Used for other purposes.
													Labor-Intensive Process: The salt mining process is labor-intensive, involving digging, carrying, and processing the salt, often under harsh conditions. It provides a livelihood for a significant portion of the local population.
													Economic Significance: The salt from Lake Katwe is distributed and sold in various parts of Uganda and even across borders, contributing to the regional economy.
													Ecology and Wildlife
													The high salinity of Lake Katwe creates a unique and challenging environment for life.

													Specialized Organisms: Only extremophile microorganisms, such as certain types of algae and bacteria that can tolerate high salt concentrations, can survive in the lake's waters. These organisms can sometimes cause the water to appear pink or reddish.
													Limited Large Wildlife: Due to the salinity, the lake does not support fish populations or large aquatic animals like hippos or crocodiles.
													Birdlife: Despite the harsh conditions, some bird species are attracted to the lake. Flamingos, for example, are sometimes seen feeding on the specialized algae and brine shrimp that can thrive in such environments. Other waterbirds may visit the edges of the lake.

													The unique chemical composition of Lake Wankenzi means it does not support fish or other typical aquatic life.
													However, the surrounding areas are rich in biodiversity, including forests that are home to various monkeys and numerous bird species. The lake itself can be a spot for bird watching.
													Activities Around Lake Wankenzi:

													Due to the nature of the lake itself (sulphuric and oxygen-poor), activities do not take place in the lake. However, the surrounding dramatic landscape offers opportunities for:

													Hiking and nature walks: Exploring the hills and forests around the lake.
													Photography: Capturing the unique green color of the lake and the stunning panoramic views.
													Sightseeing: Taking in the beauty of the crater lake and the surrounding landscape.
													Bird watching: Spotting the diverse avian life in the area.
													Picnics: Enjoying the tranquility of the natural environment.
													Exploring areas between Lake Nyabikere and Kibale Forest.
													Tourism and Accommodation:

													Lake Wankenzi and the surrounding crater lakes are becoming increasingly popular for tourism.
													Accommodation options range from upmarket lodges to budget-friendly facilities in the area, often overlooking other crater lakes within easy reach for hikes.
													Eco-lodges and campsites can be found near the rims of some of the spectacular crater lakes in the region.
													In summary, Lake Wankenzi is a distinctive crater lake known for its unusual green, sulphuric, and salty water, which prevents aquatic life.
													However, the surrounding area offers beautiful scenery and opportunities for hiking, nature walks, bird watching, and enjoying the tranquility of the Western Ugandan landscape.</p>

																		they could have blocked river valleys with lava flows, leading to the impoundment of water and the formation of a lake. 
																		Alternatively, the lake basin itself might be a result of volcanic depression. 
																		Over time, rainwater and streams filled this basin, creating the serene lake we see today. 
																		The presence of numerous islands could be remnants of higher ground that were not submerged as the water levels rose.</p>
